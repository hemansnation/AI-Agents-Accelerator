We will focus on learning advanced architectural patterns to transition engineers from writing fragile LLM prototypes to building robust, scalable, and valuable AI systems ready for production environments.

We use the P.I.L.O.T. framework to connect technical agent development skills directly with quantifiable business outcomes.

Each of the seven projects listed below is a complete, deployable business system designed to solve a critical, real-world enterprise problem.

Completing these projects demonstrates mastery of multi-agent collaboration, advanced memory (RAG), planning, and safety patterns.


## The 7 Production AI Agent Projects

### [Project 1] Customer Support Agent

**Outcome:** Reduce support costs and improve customer response time.

Builds a multi-agent system to handle customer inquiries. This agent uses knowledge retrieval (RAG) to answer frequent questions and automatically routes or escalates complex issues to the correct human support team.

- routing
- sequential handoffs
- RAG integration

### [Project 2] Financial Analysis Agent

**Outcome:** Automate investment research and increase analyst productivity 10x.

An autonomous agent that performs complex investment research.
It integrates specialized tool use by calling external financial APIs and uses advanced reasoning patterns (like Chain of Thought) to quickly generate professional market analysis and risk reports.

- tool use
- reasoning
- data integration

### [Project 3] RAG Q&A System

**Outcome:** Transform scattered company documents into an intelligent, instant knowledge base.

This system is built for the enterprise to turn thousands of unstructured files (PDFs, internal wikis) into an accurate question answering assistant. It uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and vector databases to provide accurate, cited answers to employee questions.

- knowledge retrieval (RAG)
- memory management
- vector databases

### [Project 4] Code Reviewer Agent

**Outcome:** Eliminate code review bottlenecks and automatically enforce high code quality standards.

An agent that integrates directly into the software development workflow. It connects to the GitHub API to review pull requests, autonomously checks for style violations and security flaws, and suggests corrections before human review.

- reflection
- github integration
- structured critique

### [Project 5] Sales Qualification Agent

**Outcome:** Automate lead scoring and increase sales representative productivity by four times.

A multi-agent system designed to qualify business leads. It assigns specialist agents to research prospects, score their potential value against business criteria, and initiate initial outreach, ensuring human sales teams only handle high-value contacts.

- multi-agent collaboration
- external APIs
- planning

### [Project 6] Incident Management Agent (AIOps)

**Outcome:** Drastically reduce infrastructure incident response and resolution time.

This high impact system monitors operational health. It uses complex logic and external monitoring tools (like Datadog or Prometheus) to correlate alerts and logs, providing instant diagnosis and remediation steps during critical system failures.

- planning
- guardrails
- exception Handling
- recovery

### [Project 7] Content Generation Agent

**Outcome:** Accelerate content creation by generating professional marketing assets from a single prompt.

An agent crew that handles the entire content workflow. It includes agents specialized in research, drafting, editing, and distribution, producing ready-to-publish blog posts and social media summaries with minimal human input.

- sequential handoffs
- multi-agent coordination
- tool use

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains the final production-ready code along with a detailed explanation of the architectural patterns used (ReAct, Reflection, Planning, Guardrails).
